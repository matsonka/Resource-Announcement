RUN SPADES

conda activate de_novo
spades.py -k 21,51,71,91,111,127 --careful --pe1-1 DG33_S9_L001_R1.cutadapt.fastq --pe1-2 DG33_S9_L001_R2.cutadapt.fastq -o DG33_S9_L001_spades_output

Now I have this spades output folder called DG33_S9_L001_spades_output

cd DG33_S9_L001_spades_output

Now we can run the Quast command

quast contigs.fasta -o Quast_contigs


Use WinSCP to open the .html file to examine the quality



parameters used would be the spades.py -k 21,51,71,91,111,127 --careful --pe1-1 from De novo assembly 2
if you go to the spades manual it will give you all of the parameters that we use

We run spades and we specify a range of k-mers. So we can run multiple assemblies by adding numbers here. SPAdes only accepts odd k-mers. Max. k-mer size you can use in SPAdes is 127
The numbers are numbers of k-mers. 21 is a relatively small k-mer size
Careful means that it is going to run it slowly and be careful, it’s going to do the error correction step as careful (unlike if you say fast where it won’t look through that as careful)
Then we are going to specify paired ends reads. We have R1 and R2 and that tells us that they are paired end which means they came from the same molecule. Pe1-1 is going to be all of my forward reads and pe1-2 is going to be all of my reverse reads
-o specifies the output folder
